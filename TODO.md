## Urgency Scale
- 0: Most Urgent
- 10: Least Urgent

## Gameplay Enhancements
1. **Implement a save and load feature to allow players to save their progress and continue later**  
   - Urgency: 1  
   - Description: Develop a system that allows players to save their current game state, including their progress, inventory, and location. This feature should also enable players to load their saved game at a later time, allowing them to continue from where they left off.

2. **Add the ability to recall the last command by pressing the arrow keys**  
   - Urgency: 2  
   - Description: Enhance the command input interface by allowing players to use the up and down arrow keys to cycle through previously entered commands. This will improve user experience by making it easier to repeat or modify past commands without retyping them.

3. **Add a command history**  
   - Urgency: 3  
   - Description: Implement a feature that logs all commands entered by the player during a session. This history should be accessible to the player, allowing them to review past actions and decisions. Consider providing a way to search or filter the command history for specific entries.

4. **Introduce a tutorial mode for new players to learn the basic commands and gameplay mechanics**  
   - Urgency: 4  
   - Description: Create an interactive tutorial that guides new players through the basic commands and mechanics of the game. This mode should cover essential gameplay elements, such as navigation, resource collection, and combat, to help players become familiar with the game environment.

5. **Expand the solar system with more diverse celestial bodies and unique resources to discover**  
   - Urgency: 5  
   - Description: Enrich the game world by adding new planets, moons, and asteroids, each with distinct characteristics and resources. These additions should provide players with new opportunities for exploration and resource gathering, enhancing the overall depth and variety of the game.

6. **Implement a trading system with dynamic pricing based on supply and demand**  
   - Urgency: 6  
   - Description: Develop a trading system that allows players to buy and sell resources and goods. Prices should fluctuate based on supply and demand, encouraging players to strategize and make informed trading decisions. Consider adding trade routes and market events to further enhance the system.

7. **Add achievements or milestones to encourage exploration and resource collection**  
   - Urgency: 7  
   - Description: Introduce a system of achievements or milestones that reward players for reaching specific goals or completing certain tasks. These could include exploration achievements, resource collection milestones, or combat-related goals, providing players with additional motivation and a sense of accomplishment.

## User Interface Improvements
1. **Enhance the user interface with color coding for different types of messages (e.g., errors, success, information)**
   - Urgency: 5  
   - Description: Improve the clarity and readability of the user interface by implementing color coding for different message types. For example, use red for error messages, green for success messages, and blue for informational messages. This will help players quickly identify the nature of the messages they receive.

2. **Add sound effects for key actions like mining, docking, and traveling to enhance the gaming experience**  
   - Urgency: 6  
   - Description: Integrate sound effects for significant in-game actions, such as mining resources, docking at stations, and traveling between locations. These audio cues will enhance the immersive experience and provide players with auditory feedback for their actions.

3. **In the help, put the commands in brackets so they're easier to spot**  
   - Urgency: 8  
   - Description: Format the help documentation by placing command names in brackets or a distinct style, making them easier to identify. This will improve the usability of the help system, allowing players to quickly find and understand the commands they need.
## Code Improvements
1. **Increase test coverage to ensure code reliability**  
   - Urgency: 2  
   - Description: Expand the test suite to cover the code's functionality and to avoid regressions.

2. **Optimize performance for smoother gameplay**  
   - Urgency: 3  
   - Description: Identify and address performance bottlenecks in the game, such as slow loading times or lag during gameplay. This may involve optimizing algorithms, reducing memory usage, or improving rendering efficiency to provide a smoother and more responsive experience for players.

3. **Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability**  
   - Urgency: 4  
   - Description: Review and refactor the existing codebase to enhance its readability and maintainability. This may include reorganizing code, renaming variables and functions for clarity, and removing redundant or outdated code. The goal is to make the code easier to understand and modify for future development.

## New Features
1. **Introduce random events to add unpredictability to the game**  
   - Urgency: 7  
   - Description: Create a system for random events that can occur during gameplay, such as meteor showers, pirate attacks, or resource discoveries. These events should add an element of unpredictability and excitement, encouraging players to adapt their strategies and stay engaged with the game.
